### This fork by Alex Tran (muskit) adds automatic playback of audio during muted ad breaks.

Instead of no music during ad breaks, you can now choose an audio clip to play while Spotify is muted!

*Working off commit `a4bd292976c53186b2f054b21ba0aa46eb17ef10`, the last commit involved in the latest binary release from MatrixDJ96.*
# EZBlocker 2

### This is an <i>unofficial</i> successor of [EZBlocker][1] by Eric Zhang

#

### Information

EZBlocker 2 is ad muter/blocker for Spotify.<br>
It is compatible with every O.S. which supports <b>.NET Framework 4.5+</b>.<br>
(<b>Also Windows Store version is supported!</b>)

You could choose 2 different options:
- Mute ads (if an ad does load, it will mute Spotify until the ad is over)
- Block ads (apply hosts patches on system to prevent ads on Spotify from loading)

<b>No setup required, it's a portable application!</b><br>
To update your EZBlocker 2, replace the executable or use <b>auto-update</b> process.<br>

#

### How it works

Mute ads:
- <s>Basically Spotify desktop runs a web server on 127.0.0.1 that contains information about Spotify status. EZBlocker 2 attempts to extract song information hooking to this local server. To use this non-intrusive method, web helper in Spotify must be enabled.</s>
- EZBlocker 2 attempts to extract song information hooking to the new [Spotify Web API][8]. To use this official method you need to connect with your Spotify account (using any browser) and it is necessary to accept the request. (<a href="https://developer.spotify.com/assets/oauth.png">Example</a>)

Block ads:
- To prevent ads on Spotify from loading EZBlocker 2 must apply <b>hosts patches</b> on your system. These patches to be applied should require administrator rights.
- <s>Enabling this option will be disabled automatic update for Spotify!</s>

### Error reporting

EZBlocker 2 will create a log with all errors detected. If you want to open a issue on GitHub, it would be better to attach that log to receive a better solution.
